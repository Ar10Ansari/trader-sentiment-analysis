# Executive Summary

This analysis examines how Bitcoin market sentiment impacts trader behavior and profitability on Hyperliquid.

After merging daily sentiment data with trader activity, we evaluated performance, leverage usage, trade frequency, and volatility across different market regimes.

Findings indicate that traders perform strongest during Fear conditions, likely due to increased volatility creating exploitable price movements. Conversely, standard Greed periods show lower profitability, potentially due to overconfidence-driven overtrading.

Trader segmentation reveals two profitable archetypes: aggressive high-volatility traders and conservative consistent performers. Underperforming traders exhibit inefficient risk-return profiles.

The study recommends dynamic leverage adjustment and sentiment-aware exposure controls to improve risk-adjusted returns.
